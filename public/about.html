<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello There!</p>

<p>I'm Sandra from Brazil. I have lived in England for three years. When I returned to Brazil I became an English teacher and openned a Language School in 2008.
  For many years the company was successful and had over 300 students. In 2020 and the pandemy began, we started teaching online. It was a difficult for everybody. 
  The students quit the course and the school wasn't profitable anymore.

<p>I kept teaching English online. Working online is awesome. No commuting to work. Spending more time with my family. Quality life is very important when you want
   to deliver a good job. I discovered I spent to much time outside and this time was lost .</p>
